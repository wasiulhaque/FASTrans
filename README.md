An android app built using Java to reserve transportation seats and generate virtual ticket for the user
The main idea of our project was to create an online application that will allow the user to book the ticket of desired vehicle on desired destination in a selected date. All it requires is to provide the necessary information of the journey and the app will fetch information about available vehicles with available seat information.
